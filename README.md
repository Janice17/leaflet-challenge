# leaflet-challenge
Module 15 Challenge - In this challenge, the task is to develop a way to visualize USGS data that will allow the United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short, to better educaate the public and other government organizations (to hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet. 
# Code Source:
index.html (interactive leaflet map).  
logic.js (web development project setup serves as the backbone of the JavaScrip codebase).
# Part1: Create the Earthquake Visualization
1. Got the dataset from the USGS Geo JSON Feed.  
2. Imported and visualized the data:  
- Used Leaflet, created a map that plots all the earthquakes from your dataset based on their longitude and latitude.  
 - Data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger, and earthquakes with greater depth appear darker in color.  
- Included popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when its associated marker is clicked.  
- Created a legend that provides context for the map data.
# Part2: Gather and Plot More Data
Plotted a second dataset on your map to illustrate the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity.  
- Plotted the tectonic plates dataset on the map in addition to the earthquakes.  
- Added other base maps to choose from.  
- Put each dataset into separate overalays that can be turned on and off independently.  
- Added layer controls to your map.
